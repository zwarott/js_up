def int64_to_int32(gpkg_path):
    """
    Converts all fields of type Int64 (64-bit integer) to Int32 (32-bit integer) in all layers of a GeoPackage file.

    This function opens the specified GeoPackage, identifies fields with the `Int64` type in each layer, and creates new
    fields of type `Int32`. It then copies data from the `Int64` fields to the new `Int32` fields, handles potential
    overflow cases where `Int64` values exceed the `Int32` range, and finally deletes the original `Int64` fields,
    renaming the `Int32` fields to match the original field names.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gpkg_path : str
        The file path to the input GeoPackage (.gpkg) file.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If the GeoPackage file cannot be opened.

    Notes
    -----
    - The function checks for potential integer overflow when copying values from `Int64` to `Int32` fields. If a value
      exceeds the `Int32` range (`-2147483648` to `2147483647`), a warning is printed, and the value is skipped.
    - If a new `Int32` field already exists (i.e., it was created in a previous run), the field creation is skipped to
      avoid duplicate column names.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> int64_to_int32("path/to/geopackage.gpkg")
    Processing layer: Layer1
    Converting field field_name from Int64 to Int32.
